Instructions for running the program 

-Download the source file "Hw7.java" 
-run the commands javac Hw7.java && java Hw7 in the terminal 
-Enter the carMake and the Model Year as prompted on the screen 
-the output will be generated in a text file with the carMake name:
E.g: BMW-350.txt

- for more info on how to run the program refer to the logs script

Homework 7

Write a car class named Car that has the following fields:

• yearModel. The yearModel field is an integer that holds the car’s year model.

• make. The make field references a String object that holds the make of the car.

• speed. The speed field is an int that holds the car’s current speed.
The class should have the following constructor and other methods.

• Constructor. The constructor should accept the car’s year model and make as arguments. These
values should be assigned to the object’s yearModel and make fields. The constructor should also
assign 0 to the speed field.

• Accessors. Appropriate accessor methods should get the values stored in an object’s yearModel,
make, and speed fields.

• accelerate(). The accelerate method should add 5 to the speed field each time it is called.

• brake(). The brake method should subtract 5 from the speed field each time it is called and also
decrease fuel.
In the same source file, design a set of classes that will work together to simulate a car’s fuel gauge and
odometer for the car. The classes you will design are the following:
The FuelGauge Class: This class will simulate a fuel gauge. Its responsibilities are as follows:

• To know the car’s current amount of fuel, in gallons.

• To report the car’s current amount of fuel, in gallons.

• To be able to increment the amount of fuel by 1 gallon. This simulates putting fuel in the car.
(The car can hold a maximum of 15 gallons.)

• To be able to decrement the amount of fuel by 1 gallon plus a fraction generated by the
Math.random() method, if the amount of fuel is greater than 0 gallons. This simulates burning
fuel as the car runs.

The Odometer Class: This class will simulate the car’s odometer. Its responsibilities are
as follows:

• To know the car’s current mileage.

• To report the car’s current mileage.

• To be able to increment the current mileage by 1 mile. The maximum mileage the odometer
can store is 999,999 miles. When this amount is exceeded, the odometer resets the current
mileage to 0.

• To be able to work with a FuelGauge object. It should decrease the FuelGauge object’s
current amount of fuel by 1 gallon for every 24 miles traveled. (The car’s fuel economy is 24
miles per gallon.)

Demonstrate the classes in a program by creating instances of each class. Simulate filling the car up with
fuel, and then run a loop that increments the odometer (accelerating multiples of 5 and braking) until the
car runs out of fuel. During each loop iteration, print the car’s current mileage and amount of fuel. After
each call to the brake method, get the current speed of the car and display it.
