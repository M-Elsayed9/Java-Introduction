 * Input variables: Homework grade, Codelab grade, Midterm1 grade, Midterm2 grade, Final grade.
 * we will scan the inputs for the above variables using a system scanner
 * arithmetic operation: Homework grade + Codelab grade + midterm1 + midterm2, + final = total score
 * Output variable: Total Score 
 * display the calculated value of the total score
