Instructions for running program 1: 

1-Download the src file (program1.java) & the inputfile (HW3inputFile.txt) into one folder.
2-open the terminal and run the command javac program1.java to compile
3-run the command java program1 to run the program, this will generate the output file (pgm1_outputFile.txt) which has the results

instructions for running program 2:

1-Download the src file (program2.java)
2-open the terminal to the src file location and run the command javac program2.java to compile
3-run the command java program2 to run the program
4-follow the instructions on the screen to choose the type of calculator or to exit the program.

Instructions for running program 3: 

1-Download the src file (program3.java) & the inputfile (pgm3inputFile.txt) into one folder.
2-open the terminal and run the command javac program3.java to compile
3-run the command java program3 to run the program, this will generate the output file (pgm3outputFile.txt) which has the results

(for more information on how to compile&run refer to logs script)

*Program 1: Practice writing static methods and calling static methods from the main method. Given a
file with different integer N values listed (one number per line), calculating the following arithmetic
expressions and output to an output file. Each of the following computations should be organized into
separate methods.
	-Factorial Method: This method takes in 1 input n and calculates the factorial value for that number. The
output should print the message: The factorial of _____ is _____.
For example, 3! = 3 * 2 * 1
	-Sum of squares Method: This method takes in 1 input n and calculates the sum of the squares for the
number series ending in that number. The output should print the message: The sum of squares
is ____.
For example, 3 will yield 1+4+9 = 14
	-Fibonacci sequence Method: This method takes in 1 input n and prints the fibonacci sequence for n
elements of the sequence. Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...


*Program 2: Practice expressing control flow using conditionals. This program builds upon your work
from homework 1. Using standard stream input, prompt the user to choose an option for a shape. Then,
depending on the shape, ask for the relevant parameters (i.e. radius, width, length) and output the area and
either of circumference or perimeter for that shape.


*Program 3: Practice time-based calculations. Build an age calculator that takes in a list of values from an
input file that contains Month, Day, and Year â€“ calculate the appropriate age for each record from the
values in the line. A record is one line in the input file.
