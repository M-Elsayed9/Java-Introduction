**How to run the source file

1-download the source file "arrayMethods.java" to your device

2-in the terminal write the commands "javac arrayMethods.java"  to compile 
&& "java arrayMethods" to run the program. 
the output should be on the screen displaying the four methods output

Homework 4


Practice working with arrays and polymorphism with method overloading; pass-by-value and scope of
variables by writing the following methods and statements.

Methods:

1. Write a method basicArray that does not take any inputs. In this method, write statements to
declare an int array called nums with 50 elements. Write the statements to store the values 1
through 50 in the elements of nums, add 10 to each entry of the array nums, then print every
element of nums.

2. Write a method printElements that accepts an array of Strings as the input parameter argument.
The output of this function is that it will print elements of the array. Make sure that your function
verifies that each element is a string type and prints those array elements to String objects.

3. Write another method printElements that accepts a two-dimensional array of ints as the input
parameter argument. The output of this function is that it will print elements of the 2D array. The
output should be in a matrix form (that is, with rows and columns) with each element separated
by a white space. Use the printf() function to format the output with clean alignment.

4. Write a method printElements that accepts an array of Time Objects as the parameter argument.
The output of this function is that it will print elements of the array. Make sure that your function
verifies that each element is a Time type and prints those array elements as strings.
